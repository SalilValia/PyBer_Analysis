# PyBer_Analysis

## Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to understand how to use the Pandas, Numpys, and Matplotlib libraries functions in Jupyter notebook. 
In Deliverable 1, we were able to creat a Pyber summary of by type for rural, suburban, and urban sections.

For Step 8, we cleaned the data to added the format of $ for the fares.

In Deliverable 2 we used the groupby funtion and pivot function to create the date into an index, the cities into a type, and the fares into a value.
after creating that dataframe the spots with no fares with given NaN in their cells. I ended up getting the data from the first 5 and last 5 instead of doing head(10)
